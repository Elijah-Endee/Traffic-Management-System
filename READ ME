With this repository, I will be detailing my journey learning and implementing a simple autonomous traffic management system.
This would require me putting to practice the knowledge i have acquired thus far in my system work where i had to learn concepts such as:
High Level synthesis, EDF scheduling on multi core, Queuing system and other useful algorithms used in this done.
My project paper would also be added to this repository.
